Hello everyone, this is a test file that I use to test if committing works well.

When you first time export our project to your local computer or os-class, you need "svn checkout" command. 
Usage: svn checkout svn+ssh://username@os-class.engr.oregonstate.edu/scratch/cs411-group17

More information about svn command, you can see http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/edguide/chapter03.html
